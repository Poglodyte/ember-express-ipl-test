# back-end

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Express application.
A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

## Running / Development

* `DEBUG=back-end:* npm start`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Using nodemon to "live-reload" on code changes

You can install nodemon globally:

* `npm install -g nodemon`
* Now you can run with `DEBUG=back-end:* nodemon`

Or just use nodemon that comes with the devDependencies by running the devstart script:

* Run the app with `DEBUG=back-end:* run devstart`
